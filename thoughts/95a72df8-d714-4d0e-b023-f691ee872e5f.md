Swing x Improv and Feminism in Society
======================================

Well my, I hope not too naive opinion is that, as everyone knows, an typical body of female is different to typical body of male. This means kinds of work are gonna be better suited for typical male, some better suited for typical female. But that doesn't mean some male may be better for some typical female work.

I am not sure that the inequality holds for mind of female and male mind, and cognition.

What I see is that in USA, A so called "positive discrimination" in form of support or some help is being used to attract more women to the IT companies and universities. I am not really sure is this good approach[3] to achieve equality. We (developed or have-been-created) unequal for some reason.

What about those females who don't need such support? What about those females who don't want support or help? What does the majority think? Should the majority adapt to minority?


I am dancing Swing and Contact improvisation. These dances are quite dissimilar. Although as any partnership, it involves much of communication and control.

In Swing, there is strong concept of Lead & Follow. Many women like the role of Follow, many men like the role of Lead. That is the social norm. It

Swing.
======
In Swing, the Follow can influence the Lead, but it is up to the Leader how much he/she is listening and understanding the Follow. If it works, then the dance can be quite enjoyable and quite creative for both. But it also may not be. The lead may be felt as too manipulative and rude. 

I am also trying the other role then the socially-imposed role time to time. I am curios person and it needs courage to try (for me) new things. The society is quite a big ball and it is not easy to influence it.

The concept of lead/follow allows for definite direction of the dance evolution.

Contact Improv.
===============
Contact Improv is mostly Follow & Follow. It can be Lead & Follow, but the roles are not so distinct and leading and following is switched voluntarily in very short time intervals (about a second, maybe less). This allows to escape the head of single individual and thus allows quite a lot of creativity, but without a definite direction of the dancers. Any dancer should be responsible for himself and others. If this is reached, high value of harmony between the individuals is reached.

Control systems.
================
Every action has some form of reaction and people are surely highly complex adaptive systems[2] (or something of even higher level than this). Complex systems outcomes are very hard to predict without good knowledge of their structure and dependencies.

Each of us should think about the inputs and outputs we receive and give.
If we want to go more with the flow, we need to listen.
If we overreact, we may destabilize the system and we are hard to control
If we don't react, we are also not easy to control. It is good to keep the momentum.

If we want to influence others, we offer the feedback. The timing is important. Any feedback -- negative or positive can destabilize the system with memory.

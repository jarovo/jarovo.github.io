    Waiting for the train
    here it comes... the rain
    in the far lands tunder-storm
    waiting on the step for horn
    to shout loud I'll be back home soon
    when there is no star no moon
    please come visit me at noon
    we'll go out and I'll make pun
    that this was a short rainy run
    it will last for eternity:
    Awesome lady, see you pretty
    soon.

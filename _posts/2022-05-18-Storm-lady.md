    Waiting for the train
    when she comes... the rain!
    in the far lands... tunder-storm
    waiting on the step... train horn

    Points the finger there my home...
    I don't want to stay alone
    in this stormy weather... bus!
    Taking just 2 people - us.

    Looking... there's no star no moon
    please come visit me at noon
    we'll go out, we came home,
    next adwenture? We'll make some.

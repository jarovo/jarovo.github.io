Waiting for the train
here it comes... the rain
in the far lands tunder-storm
waiting on the step for horn
to shout loud I'll back home soon
when there is no star no moon
please come visit me at home
forget the napkin, I have some.

Norweigian wood I have there none.
I will call you my handsome
princess of the far good lands
for your precious soft warm hands.
They will lay on me for fun.
Then please tell me you will be mum.
Of our children girls or boys
I will make them wooden toys.

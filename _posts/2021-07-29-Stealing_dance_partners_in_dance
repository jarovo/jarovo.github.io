Stealing dance partners in dance
================================

This is fun activity practiced mainly on birthday jams or among the friends,
in friendly atmosphere. Note that, of course, it may not be good to replace
some stranger in the dance parties or someone who cannot steal back,
or replacing the one having a birthsday on the birthsday jam.

The technique:
 * Listen to the music, keep bouncing and move with the music.
 * Commit to the idea of stealing the partner. Go in the circle to let other
   know you are about to steal. Be persuasive.
 * Make an eye contact with the one you are about to replace and/or with
   his/her partner in the dance.
 * It is also possible to steal as a surprise, but doing so please be alert
   and let yourself be noticed by warm contact of your hand.
 * Mimic the moves the one you are replacing does.
 * We can cooperate in stealing partners -- meaning:
   * The one about to be replaced may yield his/her role with ease to you
     - the thief.
   * Or may challenge the you thief a bit by being in the way of the thief.
 * Partner can be stolen by
   * replacing the hand -- the left one for the leader right for the folower.
   * Catching the body of the partner.
   * Getting between the partners.
 * Various situations can arise when stealing the partner, like dancing with
   two partners at once.
 * A pair can decide to replace with the partners of the other pair.
 * Strive for smoothness of the steal.
 * Practice makes perfect.
 * Steal often when practicing.
 * Have fun!

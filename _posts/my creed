Better safe then sorry,
rather sorry then regret,
that's how to live my story,
with great creed we do strive

Rather to worry then to hate or fear.
what is the past needs to closed,
give up the battles that are now lost.
Help to the alive, also the host.

For the great vison create the will,
before leaving pay with no bill.
Act for the good, did understood?
make up the mood and then serve food.

Clean up the mess
Stand up and straight
Shoulders back on the path
eat slow to win - pleasure, no sin
Do we want more? Let's get a hoe.

Hoe to the land, better then sand
in the pants, what do you want?
err what a world...
Ohm my good lord!

When you want help you may have to give
away a beer, the future is near
live long and well
without a hell.

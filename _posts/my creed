Better safe then sorry
Better sorry then regret
Better live your story
with great will we strive

Rather to worry then hate or to fear.
What is the past needs to closed,
Give up the battles that are now lost.
Help with the lives, also the host.

When you want help you may have to give
Away a beer, future is near
live long and well
without the hell.

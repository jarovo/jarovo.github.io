Better safe then sorry
Better sorry then regret
Better live your story
with great creed we strive

Rather to worry then hate or to fear.
What is the past needs to closed,
Give up the battles that are now lost.
Help with the lives, also the host.

For the vison create will,
before leaving pay the bill
Act for good, understood?
make the mood and the food

Clean up the mess
Stand up and straight
Shoulders back on the path
eat slow to win - pleasure, no sin
Do we want more? Let's get a hoe.

Hoe to the land, better then sand
in the pants, wand
err what a world...
Ohm my good lord!

When you want help you may have to give
Away a beer, future is near
live long and well
without the hell.

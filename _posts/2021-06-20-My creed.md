Better safe than sorry,
that's how to live our story,
rather sorry than regret,
the great creed -- our decret.

Rather to worry than to hate or fear.
what is the past needs to close,
give up the battles that are now lost.
Help to the alive, also the host.

For the great vison create the will,
before leaving pay the bill.
Act for the good, who understood?
make up the mood and then serve food.

Clean up the mess
Stand up and straight
Shoulders back, in the pack
eat slow to win -- pleasure, no sin

Hoe to the land, better than sand
in the pants, what do you want?
Err? What a world...
Ohm my good Lord!

When you want help you may have to give
away a beer, the future is near
live long and well
without the hell.

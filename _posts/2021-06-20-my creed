Better safe than sorry,
rather sorry than regret,
that's how to live our story,
with great creed we do strive

Rather to worry than to hate or fear.
what is the past needs to close,
give up the battles that are now lost.
Help to the alive, also the host.

For the great vison create the will,
before leaving pay the bill.
Act for the good, who understood?
make up the mood and then serve food.

Clean up the mess
Stand up and straight
Shoulders back on the path
eat slow to win - pleasure, no sin

Hoe to the land, better than sand
in the pants, what do you want?
err what a world...
Ohm my good Lord!

When you want help you may have to give
away a beer, the future is near
live long and well
without a hell.

by Finnegan McBride.

## Preparation
1. Know 3-4 times as much as you will communicate.
2. Have a point.
3. Have multiple stories at hand to illustrate your point.
4. Sit for 30 minutes with your eyes closed before speaking and organize your ideas around a problem.

## The talk itself
1. Talk about what you know.
2. Use stories from personal experience.
3. Talk to one individual at once.
4. Every fact you share must be given for a clear purpose.
5. The talk should be an unplotted exploration of a set of ideas.
6. Donâ€™t rely on notes or a predetermined structure.
7. Recognize that there is a high probability of failure.
8. Relate the talk to work you have been doing over time.
9. Have a very difficult problem to attempt to grapple with.
